        <h2>Problem statement</h2>
        <p>Code Enigma’s branding and website had become dated and needed to reflect the new direction of the business while reflecting a professional yet playful persona.</p>
        <p>They needed a refresh that focussed on a much more content driven and modern approach with and emphasis on accessibility while decluttering what was there across both the website and internal documentation.</p>
      </div>

          <div class="odd">
            <p>Updated branding to represent the whole company</p>

        </div>

        <img src="/img/work/ce/logo.jpg" />

      </div>

      <!-- Solution one  -->
      <div class="content" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-duration="300">
        <h2>Modernizing the brand</h2>
        <p>The previous branding featured a motif that seemed out of place and little more than an emblem reminiscent of trendy tech companies of the early 2000s. Although nobody is fully aware of how it originated, the best explanation I received was, “It’s a bit of an enigma”.  I think that phrase set the tone for the whole artwork direction, confusion is not a trait that is best associated with when selling yourself.</p>
        <p>The new direction encompasses the entire company through the use of simple iconography yeah differentiates with bold colours to represent personality.</p>
        <p>Pushing content to the forefront  was a key objective so a new, clear typeface was chosen and then coupled with vintage, monochrome photography so as to not overpower text while maintaining the sense that they try not to take themselves too seriously.</p>
        <p>I wrote a <a href=“”#>blog</a> about this previously if you’d like to know more about the design thinking that went into the rebranding.</p>

      </div>

      <!-- Solution two  -->
      <div class="content" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-duration="300">
        <h2>A clear user journey</h2>
        <p>Code Enigma has a diverse team offering everything from accessibility auditing to fully managed AWS solutions. The key to producing fluid user experience was to simplify the user journey through a much more simple navigation.</p>
        <p>A potential customer that is interested in specific service will usually be interested in one of their other services and so a clear, uncomplicated journey encourages the user to explore further.</p>

      <!-- Solution three  -->
      <div class="content" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-duration="300">
        <h2>Improving UX through typography</h2>
        <p>With improving content being one of the biggest driving forces behind this project, typeface and layout of both digital and print material was paramount. Each of these mediums was considered carefully and the end result is readable and accessible with regular praise coming from the work undertaken on internal documentation.</p>

      <!-- Retrospective  -->
      <div class="content" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-duration="300">
        <h2>What have I learned</h2>
        <p>I have always been of the opinion that content is king, it’s the driving philosophy behind my design processes and this project backed up that point more than any other.  Working closely with developers is a given in digital product design but that same collaboration can be overlooked  when it comes to editorial. The main takeaway from this project is to insist that resource is available regularly and from a very early stage in the process.</p>
